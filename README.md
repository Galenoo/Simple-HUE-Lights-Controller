# Simple-HUE-Lights-Controller
Minimalistic and simple controller for Philips HUE lights, only white ones and no colored ones are supported

## How to use
Make sure you have **requests** and **customtkinter** installed

**If you already have your bridge username**, just copy and paste it into the hue_user.json file.

**If you don't already have it, delete the file hue_user.json**, and the program will initialize the procedure to create one and ask you to press the button on the bridge

The light status gets updated every 5 seconds
